# Make a Bean Blink On an iOS App

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to implement the Bean's iOS SDK.  We will be building an app that has a button and a label.  When you press the button, the label's text will change and the Bean will blink its onboard RGB LED.  

After this tutorial, you should have a good step forward in implementing our SDK into your projects or prototypes. 

Checkout the [Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean-from-wireframe)! You can find the more info on the [Bean's iOS SDK](https://github.com/PunchThrough/Bean-iOS-OSX-SDK) so that the app knows how to communicate to the Bean. The reference documentation for the SDK can be found [here](https://punchthrough.com/files/bean/sdk-docs/index.html).
