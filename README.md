# Make a Bean Blink On an iOS App

The purpose of this tutorial is to demostrate how to implement Punch Through's iOS SDK.  We implement a table view, that allows you to select the Bean you want to connect.  Once you have selected the Bean, you can press the "Press Me" button and see the Bean blink!

Checkout the [Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean-from-wireframe)! You can find the more info on the [Bean's iOS SDK](https://github.com/PunchThrough/Bean-iOS-OSX-SDK) so that the app knows how to communicate to the Bean. The reference documentation for the SDK can be found [here](https://punchthrough.com/files/bean/sdk-docs/index.html).

To learn how to use the Bean, visit the [Getting started guide](https://www.punchthrough.com/bean/guides/getting-started/intro/)
